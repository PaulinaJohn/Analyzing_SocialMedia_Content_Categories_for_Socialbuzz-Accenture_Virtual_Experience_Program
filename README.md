I got on the Accenture data analytics [virtual experience program](https://www.theforage.com/fast-track/data-analytics-virtual-experience/overview?ref=BoPbiqx5GRLbyYXPu) in which I helped Social Buzz, a fast-growing social media technology unicorn analyse their content categories.

Social Buzz is dealing with a monthly influx of users and daily influx of highly unstructured content. Asides needing help with scaling its processes to handle this volume and variety of data, it wants to find out its top 5 most popular content categories, amongst other insights.

Interesting aspects of this work for me, have to be:

-Pausing on my love for Python (my favourite language) and reaching for other tools in my toolkit to implement my solution, as well as, switching through three different technologies to get the job done, even though the program allowed me to use just Spreadsheets. 
I cleaned and mergeed my datasets with SQL, analyzed for the top 5 content categories using Google Sheets, and did my reporting with PowerBi.

And, I'll say the most interesting part for me was sharing my insights through presentation preparation and delivery, as I share that bias that the most important stakeholders to factor in when sharing technical information is the non-technical audience, which, almost always constitutes the most important stakeholders. I have shared snippets of my presentation below.

technical information find better use when they are communicated in an easy-to-digest manner. Check out snippets of my slides below. 

Also, check out my SQL queries and Spreadsheet syntaxes in my GutHub repository for this project.

Want to try the project yourself? why not? get on the program through the forage platfrom using this link.


I found this project interesting as, instead of using only one technoloygy (Spreadsheets), I decided to create a flow around three different technologies - SQL, Spreadsheets and Bi.

I used SQL(MSSQL) for cleaning and merging my data, Spreadsheets (Google Sheets) for analysis and a BI tool (PowerBi) for creating my visualizations. 

The most interesting part for me was sharing my insights through presentation preparation and delivery. See my full presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RoJQ2Eo_xkoKWXtYn78tbdrWCVWRrLJWjXf5cDYnUmE/edit?usp=sharing)
