I got on the Accenture data analytics [virtual experience program](https://www.theforage.com/fast-track/data-analytics-virtual-experience/overview?ref=BoPbiqx5GRLbyYXPu) in which I helped Social Buzz, a fast-growing social media technology unicorn analyse their content categories.

Social Buzz is dealing with a high monthly influx of users and daily influx of unstructured content. Asides needing help with scaling its processes to handle this volume and variety of data, it wants to find out its top 5 most popular content categories, amongst other insights.

I found this project interesting as, instead of using only one technoloygy (spreadsheets), I decided to create a flow around three different technologies - SQL(MSSQL), spreadsheets (Google Sheets) and a Bi tool (PowerBi).

I used MSSQL for cleaning and merging my data, Google Sheets for analysis and PowerBi for creating my report, shown below

The most interesting aspect for me was sharing my insights through presentation preparation and delivery, as I consider my non-technical stakeholdeers as the most important stakeholders and this helps me communicate technical information to them in an easy-to-digest from.
