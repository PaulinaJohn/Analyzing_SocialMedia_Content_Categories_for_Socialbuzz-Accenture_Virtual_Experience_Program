I got on the Accenture data analytics [virtual experience program](https://www.theforage.com/fast-track/data-analytics-virtual-experience/overview?ref=BoPbiqx5GRLbyYXPu) in which I helped Social Buzz, a fast-growing social media technology unicorn analyse their content categories.

Social Buzz is dealing with high influx of users each month and highly unstructured content daily. It needs help with scaling its processes to handle this volume and variety of data and wants to find out its top 5 most popular content categories, amongst other insights.
